                    Welcome to HELP! The Higher Education Learning Program! This website is the result of a project for the Capstone in Computer Science class CSCI 440 taught by David Chiu in the Spring semester of 2020. This project was brought to David by biomechanics professor George Tomlin who served as an advisor and end user for the project. After presenting the project to all capstone students, four students were selected to work on the project and will be introduced in a bit!
                </p>
                <p class = "about">
                    While teaching his biomechanics courses, George self-taught and created an online tutorial and study tool for his students using the software, Authorware. This project lives in Weyerhaeuser Hall on the University of Puget Sound, in a small room some students and professors have access to except for when it was briefly moved to the fourth floor of Thompson Hall for the duration of this capstone project. The program was set up on a few very old machines that held the software for the study tool. These machines were slowly but surely approaching the time where the no longer work functionally. After all but one of these computers stopped working, George approached the computer science department to see if students would be able to re-create his study tool.
                </p>
                <p class = "about">
                    In its original glory, the study tool used individual slides to create the illusion of transitions as well as to convey information. You could only go forward through the linear program and to access the supplemental video, a 2 disc laserdisc set (4 sides) of the movie Help staring the Beattles was necessary and users would have to manually flip the disc. If this didn’t happen, users ran the risk of watching the wrong video clip! There were quizzes and opportunities to learn all throughout this study tool. This software evolved from cutting edge to outdated in its use and served as the inspiration for this project!
                </p>
                <p class = "about">
                    We planned to abstract this project from directly 1:1 creating a new version of the study tool to creating what you are using today! We focused on allowing professor and students interact in ways where professors can create classes and study tool, similar to George and Authorware, and students could have a more modern and intuitive user interface. This website is a study tool at heart and we hope that it gets expanded use outside of George’s Biomechanics class to potentially his whole department, all of the University of Puget Sound, and potentially other schools and universities as a great study tool that allows professors and students to have significant control over both their respective experiences.
                </p>
                <p class = "about">
                    We believe that over the course of working on this project that it has the potential to be widely used as a study and supplemental learning program with professor guided and programmed learning courses and tutorials similar to how a website like Canvas is currently being used at the University of Puget Sound as a host for quizzes, supplemental material, and feedback on courses. As we worked on this project from quarantine, we were ever reminded of how impactful an useful and secure online resource can be for students and professors. With this in mind, we strove to make a secure and intuitive experience for our users. If you are a student using this website whether that became the case or not, we hope that you genuinely enjoy the user experience and using this website as a study tool! For professors, we hope we made the interface intuitive while robust enough to hold any basic requirements for a complex study tool for your students while being easy enough to use! Thank you to all our users and we hope that you enjoy using HELP! The Higher Education Learning Program!

                    Braden Ash graduated in May 2020. He is from Lake Stevens Washington which is a short drive North on I-5 from Seattle. Braden double majored in the Business Leadership Program and Computer Science with a math minor ultimately receiving a BS for his undergraduate course work. While on campus Braden was very active in the undergraduate community playing baseball and football during his time at UPS as well as being president of a fraternity for some time along with other clubs and organizations.
