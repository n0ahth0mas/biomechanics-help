# HELP! The Higher Education Learning Program
Welcome to HELP, the Higher Education Learning Program! This project was created by [Braden Ash](https://github.com/ashbraden1), [Ricardo Barraza](https://github.com/rbarraza21), [Jack Riley](https://github.com/Jriles), and [Noah Thomas](https://github.com/n0ahth0mas) for the University of Puget Sound's Computer Science Capstone Class. The end goal of this project was to replace and update an online Biomechanics course created using a 1980s copy of Adobe Authorware. The current version of the system is up and running at [helppugetsound.com](helppugetsound.com), and can be tested by making a free account and enrolling in a demo class using the classcode **DEMO**.
