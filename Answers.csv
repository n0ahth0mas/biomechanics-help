1,1,1,Internal-muscle contractions,"Muscle contraction, an internal force, is necessary here in order to throw the dart.",,,,,,
2,1,1,Friction-internal,"This is sort of correct: There is a certain amount of internal friction in the joints which move: shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers and thumb. (But generally, healthy joints are well lubricated, reducing friction to a minimum.) For the purpose of this course, we will ignore internal friction",,,,,,
3,1,1,External-gravity,"Gravity is acting on the upper extremity (requiring some muscle contraction to hold the arm steady- mostly deltoid) and on the dart itself, giving it weight, which influences how it is thrown.",,,,,,
4,1,0,Magnetism-external,There is no magnetism active here!,,,,,,
5,1,1,Friction-external,"This is sort of correct: There is a small amount of external friction as the arm moves through the air. For the purpose of this course, we will ignore air friction.",,,,,,
6,1,1,Resistance-external,"The dart in the hand offers a force of resistance because it has mass and therefore inertia, resisting movement. The more massive the dart, the harder it will have to be thrown in order to hit the target (Ringo).",,,,,,
7,2,1,Gravity,Gravity must be overcome in order to lift each body up into the truck,,,,,,
8,2,0,Friction,Friction is not a major external force to be overcome,,,,,,
9,2,0,Muscle contraction,Muscle contraction is not an external force to be overcome,,,,,,
13,3,1,electromagnetism,"Although gravity is pulling all objects (keys, watch, lighter, Ringo's ring, etc.) toward the center of the earth, at this moment the magnetism is stronger, and sets the objects in motion (including Ringo’s arm) until they meet an external resistance- the wall or the ceiling. The wall and ceiling push back against the objects with a reactive force just strong enough to balance the pull of the magnet. Therefore, the objects don't puncture through the barriers (much to the villains' dismay, since they want to recover Ringo's ring!).

The correct answer is magnetism. The pull of the electromagnet switched on by the villains is strong enough to overcome the attraction of gravity on Ringo's arm and cause it to move upward, over his head, until it meets the obstructing ceiling. The ceiling then pushes back against his hand with an equal and opposite reactive force (see the module on Newton's Laws of Motion), which prevents his hand from punching through the ceiling (much to the villains' dismay, since they want to get his ring).",,,,,,

16,4,0,Gravity,"Gravity was not keeping him from falling through before, it is causing him to fall through now!",,,,,,
17,4,0,Friction,"Friction was not keeping Ringo from falling through the floor before. If anything, the friction between his feet and the floor may have kept him from sliding sideways, but that is all.",,,,,,
18,4,0,Resistance,"Resistance was not the force which kept Ringo from falling through the floor, as we define the word. Resistance is a force which opposes a movement, for example a weight added to your arm as you lift it. Resistance might also be an interfering force applied by another person, for example someone pushing the opposite way you are during an arm wrestle. In both these cases, the resisting force is an ACTIVE force. (Hint, Hint)",,,,,,

48,15,0,Increased mass from suitcase,"The briefcase in his hand is actually lowering his COG, therefore making him more stable (since it is then harder to ""tip"" the LOG outside the base of support). It may also be counterbalancing a move of the COG to the left due to the flexed extremities, by adding mass on the right. This counterbalancing helps keep the LOG well within the base of support. (Granted, it may make him dynamically less stable, by preventing his right arm from moving quickly to help him catch his balance.)",,,,,,
49,15,0,Raised COG from flexed extremities,"One of the reasons he is in unstable equilibrium is that by flexing his two left extremities, he has raised his COG. The higher the COG, the easier it is to ""tip"" the LOG outside the base of support. (This raising of the COG is somewhat counteracted by the briefcase in his right hand, which as added mass tends to lower the COG.)",,,,,,
50,15,1,LOG moved anteriorly and left to edge of BOS,"The flexed left arm and leg have brought mass forward (anteriorly) and to the left, so that the COG, and therefore also the LOG, are moved in those directions nearer to the edge of the base of support. The nearer the LOG is to the edge of the base of support, the easier it is to cause it to fall outside it by a push or pull (force).",,,,,,
51,15,0,Decreased friction with only one foot on carpet,"Friction does not cause or prevent unstable equilibrium. An object or person in stable equilibrium, even if on a very slippery surface (low friction) will still stay balanced unless acted upon by a large external force (for example, sitting on the surface of a frozen pond). There is a more important effect which raising one foot off the carpet has...",,,,,,
52,15,1,Decreased Base of Support (BOS) due to lifted left foot,"Reduced BOS is the most important reason why there is unstable equilibrium. Instead of the large BOS given by two feet spread apart, he is relying on one foot. It is much easier in this stance for the LOG to fall outside the BOS.",,,,,,
53,16,0,"lowered COG, expanded BOS, LOG well inside BOS","Nope! The COG has not been lowered inside his body, but raised..",,,,,,
54,16,0,"COG nearer to floor, large BOS, LOG outside BOS","Nope! The LOG is not outside the BOS. If it were, John would be falling over.",,,,,,
55,16,1,"COG nearer to earth, big BOS, LOG well inside BOS","YES!!! His COG is nearer the earth (so it is harder to ""tip * LOG), he has a much bigger BOS being on hands and knees (and toes!), and his LOG is well within the BOS. That finishes equilibrium!",,,,,,

78,4,1,Reactive Force,"The reactive force of the floor, pushing back against Ringo and his drums, is what WAS holding him up. The reactive force of the floor against Ringo is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction from the force created by gravity, pulling him and his drums toward the center of the earth. As long as the floor was intact, Ringo stayed where he was. As soon as the villains cut a large hole in the floor, however, the boards could no longer apply a reactive force, and gravity quickly won the contest! Without a base to sit on, there was nothing Ringo could do, no matter how much muscle contraction he tried to exert!",,,,,,
